## Description
You can find Python based sample code for using the External Forecast APIs. Additionally you can also find the integration to Google Vertex AI as a external platform used for forecasting. A [Blog](https://medium.com/p/a39039ad9c6b) reflects the use of this code from this repository as reference

## Requirements
Python 3 and above

## Download and Installation
Download the best practice planning view template that fits to your need here.

For more information have a look at [SAP note 3170544.](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3170544).

If you like to visualize your Planning view via Excel, then you might intall the Excel add-in and configure the access to an IBP system.
