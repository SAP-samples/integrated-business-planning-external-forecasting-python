## Description
This repository serves as a collection of code examples for using APIs that are part of SAP Integrated Business Planning (SAP IBP) for Supply Chain. These samples are not part of the product but created for developers to understand how to consume the APIs or use them to integrate with their processes. The focus is on integrating with external forecasting APIs.

You can also find the integration to Google Vertex AI as an external platform used for forecasting. See the blog [Google Vertex AI for Supply Chain Planning](https://medium.com/p/a39039ad9c6b) for reference. 

## Requirements
Python 3 and above.

## Download and Installation
Download the best practice planning view template that fits to your need here.

For more information have a look at [SAP note 3170544.](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3170544).

If you like to visualize your planning view via Excel, then you might intall the Excel add-in and configure the access to an SAP IBP system.
